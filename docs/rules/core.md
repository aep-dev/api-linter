# Core rules

Core rules are based on [generally-applicable AEPs][]. They are enabled by
default, and **should** be enabled for most APIs. It is recommended that APIs
which do not want to follow certain AEPs within the core section disable those
rules individually, rather than disabling the core rules as a set.
